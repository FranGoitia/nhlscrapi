nhlscrapi: NHL Scrapr API
===============================

Purpose
--------

Provide a Python API for accessing NHL game data including play by play, game summaries, player stats et c. The library hides the guts of the NHL website scraping process and encapsulates not only the data gathering, but data output. This project is inspired by the `R <http://www.r-project.org>`_ package *nhlscrapr*, an all around must for NHL analytics geeks and R power users.

nhlscrapi is in the early/initial stages, but will be updated regularly.
